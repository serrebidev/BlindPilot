"""Hermes Agent backend for BlindPilot.

Hermes Agent (https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) speaks several
protocols. This adapter uses its TUI gateway JSON-RPC, which Hermes documents
as the protocol for "custom hosts that want fine-grained control of sessions,
slash commands, approvals, and streaming events" — everything a screen-reader
front end needs, and the one Hermes protocol that runs over *both* a local
pipe and a network socket.

That last property is why this adapter uses the TUI gateway rather than
Hermes' ACP mode. ACP is stdio-only, so a remote Hermes would have needed a
second, unrelated protocol and a second worker. Here one worker drives both:

    local   -- ``python -m tui_gateway.entry`` over a pipe, nothing to configure
    remote  -- the same JSON-RPC over a WebSocket to ``hermes serve``

The wire format is identical on both paths — one JSON object per line, no
Content-Length framing — because Hermes' own TUI parses stdout lines and
WebSocket frames with the same call. So :class:`HermesWorker` is written
against a transport interface and never learns which one it got.

    The point of this path is a Hermes that lives on another machine — a
    home server, or a WSL instance reached over a private network — so the
    desktop can drive it without a terminal. The protocol is the same as the
    local path; only the pipe changes.

    Authentication is a query parameter, not a header. Hermes' HTTP routes do
    accept ``X-Hermes-Session-Token``, but the WebSocket upgrade reads its
    credential from the URL and refuses the handshake without one - a header
    alone is answered with 403. Two credential names are meant for a client a
    person configures: ``token`` for the server's session token, and
    ``ticket`` for the one-shot ticket minted after a password login on a
    server reachable from outside this machine.

    The ticket is not the only thing the upgrade carries. The cookies the login
    established go with it, because a ticket is known only to the process that
    minted it: a load balancer that hands the upgrade to a different Hermes
    refuses one it never issued, and an auth proxy refuses an upgrade with no
    session of its own. Both are decided by a cookie, and every client that
    works sends one. See ``_cookie_header``.

    The connection is read by a thread of its own, which matters for a
    connection held between turns. A Hermes bound to a public address (the
    case whenever it is reached over a private network) pings every 20 seconds
    and closes a connection that does not answer within 20 more; the client
    library only answers those pings from inside a receive call. So a
    connection nobody is reading is dropped by the server within about half a
    minute, and the reading thread is what keeps it alive while it waits.
    Frames arriving with no one waiting for them queue up rather than being
    lost, so an event that lands between turns is still there for the next one.

    ``live_keys`` holds the session keys that currently run inside the target
    gateway process, so the caller can mark them attachable.

    Two questions, two answers. ``session.list`` reads the profile database and
    shows every human conversation on every surface (CLI, TUI, messaging) --
    that is the "go back to any conversation" list. ``session.active_list``
    reports only sessions with an agent in the gateway process -- a session on
    that list can be attached to live, with its running turn.

    A row whose source is internal bookkeeping (kanban workers, tool runs) is
    dropped, the same deny-list Hermes' own resume picker uses.
