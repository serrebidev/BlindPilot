"""Backend adapters for BlindPilot.

BlindPilot began as Claude Code Reader. Claude's adapter remains in
``blindpilot_app.py``; this module contains the
provider-neutral discovery helpers plus the Codex, FreeBuff, and opencode
workers.
Hermes lives in ``hermes_backend.py`` and ``hermes_worker.py``, imported
on demand so a machine without Hermes pays nothing for it.

Codex's app-server used to be started fresh for every turn and killed at the
end of it. It is now owned by ``backend_pool``: one process shared by every
tab, held across turns instead of torn down between them, so a conversation
does not pay the app-server's start-up -- and, where MCP servers are
configured, all of their child processes' start-up too -- on every message.
``backend_pool.py`` decides how long that process lives; what is here says
only how to start, check, and stop it.

#                request on the same stream-json channel a turn is driven over.
#   Codex        the same shape, from the `account/rateLimits/read` method on
#                its app-server, reusing the pooled one where a tab has it.
#   FreeBuff     a credit balance rather than a window, spent down over a cycle
#                that refills on a date. Its CLI has no command for this
#                either; the balance comes from the same account endpoint its
#                own usage banner reads, with the credentials it signed in
#                with.
#   Hermes       a pool of provider credentials rather than one account, so
#                what it meters is which of them are spent. It writes each
#                credential's last outcome to the pool file, and a spent one
#                carries the time it may be used again where the provider
#                said so.
#   opencode     nothing of its own. It spends whichever provider account is
#                connected, its server offers no route that reports one, and
#                the rate-limit headers it does read are used to decide a

# on Vertex. A limit the backend does not report is left out rather than
