"""One Claude Code process per tab, kept alive between turns.

A turn used to be a process. It was started with --resume, fed one message
over stdin, and its stdin was closed when its result arrived, so the CLI shut
down. Anything the turn had left running inside the CLI, an agent started in
the background or one resumed with SendMessage, died with it. The process now
belongs to the tab. A turn attaches, sends its message, reads to its result
and detaches. What the CLI says while no turn is attached is handed to the
panel, which starts a turn to receive it.
