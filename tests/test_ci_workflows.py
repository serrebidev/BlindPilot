"""What the GitHub Actions workflows have to guarantee.

The release workflow does run the tests and both static checks — but only on a
`v*` tag or a manual dispatch, which means nothing verifies a commit until
somebody has already decided to ship it. A broken commit is found at tag time,
with the release half made.

These read the workflow files as text rather than parsing YAML, so no parser
is added to the test dependencies for four assertions. They are not checking
that the workflows *work* — only CI itself can show that — but they do keep
the triggers and the platforms from being quietly dropped.
