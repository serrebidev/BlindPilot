"""Questions Hermes stops its turn to ask, and how BlindPilot answers them.

Measured against a live gateway: Hermes' ``clarify`` tool blocks the agent
until a ``clarify.respond`` arrives, and with ``clarify_timeout`` at zero it
blocks with no deadline at all. The worker used to announce the event and
send nothing back, so the first question a turn asked ended it -- the window
read out "Hermes is asking: a question needing the terminal" and then went
quiet for good. That wording was itself the tell: it is the fallback text,
reached because a batch clarify carries ``questions`` and the worker only
ever looked for ``question``.
