"""Pressing Enter in the gap between a turn ending and the window knowing.

A worker thread dies the moment it has *queued* its last event, not when the
window has acted on it. `on_done` goes into a mailbox that `_drain_worker_events`
empties sixteen events at a time, yielding to the native queue between batches
so that keystrokes and screen-reader events get a turn — which means a waiting
Enter is dispatched *inside* that gap by design, not by bad luck.

For the whole of that gap `is_alive()` says False while turn 1's `complete`
and `done` are still pending. Anything that asked `is_alive()` therefore
believed no run was in progress, and let the next turn start on top of the
last one's unfinished bookkeeping.
