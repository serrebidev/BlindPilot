"""Hermes backend regression tests.

These lock down the behaviours that were wrong in the first working version
and were only found by talking to a real Hermes: the spinner arriving as
reasoning, a tool result that is an object rather than a string, and a status
check whose exit code says nothing. Each of those produced a turn that looked
successful while losing something a screen-reader user needs.
