"""Every backend's worker really does provide what the window calls on it.

`AgentWorker` is the Protocol the window holds a worker through, so that it
can drive whichever backend was chosen without knowing which one it is. It
declared start, is_alive, join and cancel — but not `steer`, which
`_on_steer` calls directly. All four workers happened to implement it, so
nothing ever broke; a fifth that did not would have type-checked clean and
failed the first time somebody pressed Steer.

The window's own call site used to be `getattr(worker, "steer")(text)`, which
is what hid it: written that way, neither a reader nor a checker could see
that the Protocol was short.
