"""What the New Session dialog says, and does not say.

Three announcements a screen reader user can hear from this dialog, judged
against the standard the install wizard was held to after a captured NVDA log:
no sentence may name something that has nothing to do with it, context a dialog
is built around cannot be silent, and nothing may be spoken twice.

1. The help under the name field said "let Hermes name it after your first
   message" in BOTH modes. True for Hermes. False for a local Claude, Codex,
   FreeBuff or opencode session, where the first message names the tab and
   Hermes is not involved in naming anything at all -- the same class of false
   statement as the wizard's "npm could not be installed".

2. In remote mode the dialog is built around an explanation -- the session
   will run on another machine, so folders on this computer do not apply --
   and it was a StaticText, which no screen reader announces when the dialog
   opens. The user landed on the name field having heard none of the context
   that makes the dialog's shape make sense.

3. A refused folder was announced explicitly and then shown in a modal
   dialog, which announces it again -- the same duplicate-speech class as the
   backend-selection announcement removed in an earlier release.
