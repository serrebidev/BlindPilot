"""Where things live in the menu bar.

File had grown to fourteen items across six separator groups — fourteen arrow
presses to hear what was in it, mixing "open a session", "stop the running
task" and "quit". Splitting it means the menu bar itself tells you where to
look: File for sessions and the application, Conversation for this
conversation and the next message, Model for what answers you.

The other half of this is that the menu bar should be the *complete* list of
what the app can do. Sighted applications deliberately offer the same command
as a button, a menu item and a shortcut; the menu is where a command is found
and where its shortcut is learnt. Attach, Slash and Jump to Latest Response
each had a control or a chord and no menu entry, so the chord could only be
discovered by being told.
