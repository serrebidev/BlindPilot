"""Saying what a search did.

`open_find` reported its outcome with `_set_status`, which writes the status
bar and nothing else — no screen reader reads a status bar it was not asked to.
When the search matched something, focus moved to the first hit and the reader
announced that row, so there was at least a sign of life. When it matched
nothing, focus did not move either: the list quietly emptied and not one thing
said so. Searching for a typo was indistinguishable from the application
ignoring the keystroke.
