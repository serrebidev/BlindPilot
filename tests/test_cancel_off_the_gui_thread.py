"""Cancelling a turn without freezing the window.

`_on_stop` already knows the rule, and says so: "cancel() waits on the
process, so it must not run on the UI thread." It starts a thread.

The two paths that close things did not. `_close_current_session` calls
`cancel_worker` straight from the menu handler, and it waits on the process and
then joins for up to three more seconds — so closing a tab mid-turn froze the
whole window, every tab of it, with no earcon and no announcement, because the
thread that would have spoken is the one that is blocked.

`_on_close` does the same thing once per tab, in a loop, so the freeze is
multiplied by however many turns are running.

Neither wait buys anything for a tab being destroyed. Quitting is different:
the CLI subprocesses have to actually be killed or they outlive the
application, so that one still waits — but on one shared budget rather than
three seconds per tab.
