"""A name typed in the New Session dialog stays on the tab.

The dialog puts the name on the tab when the session is created, and then the
first message took it away: a conversation is normally named after that message,
and nothing checked whether it already had a name. The visible result was a tab
labelled with the first words sent -- "start" for a one-word message -- while
the conversation itself was still called what the person typed, so the tab and
the conversation list disagreed about the same conversation.

Driven through the real ``SessionPanel._on_send`` rather than asserting on
``_tab_label``: the label function was already correct, and a test of it passed
throughout the defect. The thing that was wrong is WHEN the label is recomputed,
which only the send path shows.
