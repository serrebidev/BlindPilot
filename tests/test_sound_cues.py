"""Silencing one sound cue without silencing the other two.

`sounds_enabled` turns all three off together, which is the right master
switch and stays exactly as it is. But the three are not interchangeable.
Sent and Answer received are one-shots that confirm something happened;
Working is a *loop* that runs for the whole turn. It is therefore both the one
most likely to wear thin over a long fan-out and the only one that says a turn
is still alive without being asked — so wanting the loop gone is not the same
wish as wanting silence, and one switch cannot express both.
