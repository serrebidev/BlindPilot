"""The Model menu: what answers you, and what it is allowed to do.

The model and effort picker already existed and worked, but the only way to
reach it was typing `/model` into the prompt. Nothing in the menu bar
mentioned models at all, and a slash command typed into a prompt is not
something anybody finds without being told about it first. Of everything in
the app it was the one feature with no on-screen control of any kind — Attach,
Slash and Permission Mode at least have a button or a dropdown next to the
prompt.

Model, effort and permission mode are per tab, not per application, so every
one of these acts on the visible tab rather than on the window.
