"""Finding the files that configure the coding agents.

These are where an agent is actually configured — permissions, MCP servers,
model defaults, hooks — and every one of them is a dotfile in a directory
nothing announces. The only way to reach one was to leave BlindPilot, know
where to look, and find it. `open_log_folder` already exists on exactly this
reasoning: reading a path out loud and leaving somebody to navigate to it is
not a way in.

BlindPilot does not write these. It never has, apart from FreeBuff's model
choice, which FreeBuff itself rewrites after a turn. Listing them cannot create
them either: these files belong to the CLIs, which write their own on first run,
and inventing one at a path BlindPilot guessed would be worse than none — the
person would think they had configured something.

The scopes are not interchangeable and saying which is which is the point.
`.claude/settings.json` is committed to a repository and shared with whoever
else has it; `.claude/settings.local.json` is personal and gitignored. Opening
the wrong one silently is the failure this has to avoid.
