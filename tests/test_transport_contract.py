"""Every transport fake in this suite, run against the real contract.

Brandon's suggestion, closing PR #30: "a contract harness that runs every
transport fake against the real ``Transport`` semantics ... so the third fake
that lies about connection behaviour fails at write time instead of on a runner
in another country."

The registry below is the point. A new fake added to this suite and not listed
here is caught by ``test_every_fake_in_the_suite_is_registered``, which walks
the test modules and finds transport-shaped classes by their methods. Without
that, this file would guard the six fakes that exist today and quietly ignore
the seventh — which is the failure mode it was built to prevent.

The two real transports are parametrised alongside the fakes as positive
controls: a clause that is wrong about how a connection behaves fails on the
real one first, so a wrong clause cannot be mistaken for a lying fake.
