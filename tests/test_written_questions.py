"""A turn that ends by asking, without ever asking through a question tool.

Every backend opens BlindPilot's question dialog from a structured event of
its own. A model that writes its question into its answer sends none of them,
so nothing is announced and no dialog opens: the turn ends, and somebody
listening is given no sign that a turn is waiting on them. That is what an
interview skill does as a matter of course -- "grill me" is the one this was
found through -- and on Command Code, which withholds ask_user_question from
headless runs, it is the only way a question can ever arrive.

These cover the decision and the wiring around it. Whether a given piece of
prose counts as a question is tests/test_trailing_question.py.
