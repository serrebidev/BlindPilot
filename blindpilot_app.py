"""BlindPilot — accessible wxPython frontend for coding-agent CLIs.

Based on the original Claude Code Reader application. BlindPilot retains the
original application's accessibility-first design while adding pluggable
Claude Code, Codex, and FreeBuff backends.

Copyright (c) 2026 doubletaponair and BlindPilot contributors.

Uses wxPython so the UI is built from native widgets per platform — on macOS
the responses list is a real NSTableView (the same widget Finder uses), which
VoiceOver reads cleanly with no interaction quirks. On Windows the same code
uses Win32 widgets that NVDA / JAWS handle natively.

v2 segments each assistant turn into navigable *rows* (a header, one row per
paragraph / heading / list / quote, and one pristine row per fenced code block)
via the keystone parser in ``markdown_rows``. The flat list of rows sits above
the prompt box; arrowing Up from the prompt enters the newest row, while arrow
keys at either end of the list stay in the list. Tab is the only navigation key
that moves from the responses into the prompt.

Multi-session: a tab strip across the top selects one of the window's
switchable conversation pages.
Each tab owns its own conversation (session_id, prompt, rows) and its subprocess
runs with that directory as cwd, mirroring how a user would open multiple
terminal sessions in different project folders.
