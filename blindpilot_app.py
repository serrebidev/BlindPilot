"""BlindPilot, an accessible wxPython frontend for coding-agent CLIs.

Based on the original Claude Code Reader application. BlindPilot retains the
original application's accessibility-first design while adding pluggable
Claude Code, Codex, FreeBuff, opencode, and Hermes backends.

Copyright (c) 2026 doubletaponair and BlindPilot contributors.

Uses wxPython so the UI is built from native widgets per platform — on macOS
the responses list is a real NSTableView (the same widget Finder uses), which
VoiceOver reads cleanly with no interaction quirks. On Windows the same code
uses Win32 widgets that NVDA / JAWS handle natively.

v2 segments each assistant turn into navigable *rows* (a header, one row per
paragraph / heading / list / quote, and one pristine row per fenced code block)
via the keystone parser in ``markdown_rows``. The flat list of rows sits above
the prompt box; Ctrl+Up from the prompt enters the newest row, while arrow
keys at either end of the list stay in the list. Tab is the only navigation key
that moves from the responses into the prompt.

Multi-session: a tab strip across the top selects one of the window's
switchable conversation pages.
Each tab owns its own conversation (session_id, prompt, rows) and its subprocess
runs with that directory as cwd, mirroring how a user would open multiple
terminal sessions in different project folders.

    hundred lines of nested JSON and Codex's over two hundred lines of TOML; a
    text box holding either, navigated by ear, is worse than the editor
    somebody already has, and a stray comma written back breaks the CLI
    silently until it next refuses to start.

    """New Session. What it asks for depends on WHERE the session will run.

    A local backend runs in a folder on this disk, so the folder is the useful
    question and Browse can answer it. A Hermes on another machine cannot see
    this disk at all, so the folder picker is worse than useless there — it is
    misleading. Measured against a live gateway, with the result read back from
    the server's own state.db rather than from the reply:

        cwd sent = C:\\Users\\g\\Desktop\\projekt   (a Windows path, Linux Hermes)
        -> session.create returns OK, no error of any kind
        -> the session's stored cwd is '/home/ubuntu' — the SERVER's home

    The remote end validates the path against its own filesystem, silently
    substitutes its own directory, and says nothing. Meanwhile this dialog
    required the path to exist HERE, so a folder browsed to on the Windows
    desktop passed validation and the session ran somewhere else entirely, with
    the tab named after a directory it was never in.

    So in remote mode the dialog asks for a NAME, and the folder becomes an
    optional path ON THE SERVER — free text, because only that machine can say
    whether it exists, and with no Browse button, since a picker here would
    browse the wrong computer.

    The name is optional in both modes. Hermes titles a conversation from its
    first message when none is given, which is the better default for anyone
    who does not want to name things up front; a name typed here is stored with
    title_source='user' and is NOT overwritten by that automatic title
    (measured: 'Nazwa z BlindPilota' survived a completed turn, while a session
    created without one came out as 'Odpowiedź jednym słowem OK #9').
