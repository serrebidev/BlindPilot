"""Past conversations: find them on disk, title them, and read them back.

Every backend BlindPilot drives already keeps its own transcript of each
conversation, and every one of them can be resumed by id — Claude Code with
``--resume``, Codex with the app-server's ``thread/resume``, FreeBuff with
``--continue``, opencode by asking its server for the session again, Hermes with
its gateway's ``session.resume``. What was missing was a way to *find* one
again, which is what this module provides: one list of past conversations across
every backend, each titled by its first message, plus a reader that turns any of
them back into prompt-and-response turns the GUI can put in its rows.

Where each backend keeps its history:

* Claude Code — ``~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl``, one JSON
  record per line, where ``<slug>`` is the working directory with every
  non-alphanumeric character replaced by a dash.
* Codex — ``~/.codex/sessions/<year>/<month>/<day>/rollout-<stamp>-<id>.jsonl``,
  one JSON record per line, the first of which carries the session id and the
  working directory.
* FreeBuff — ``~/.config/manicode/projects/<project>/chats/<chat-id>/``, a
  directory per conversation holding ``chat-messages.json`` and a
  ``chat-meta.json`` that already stores the first prompt.
* opencode — ``~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db``, one SQLite database for
  every conversation, with a row per session, message, and message part.
* Hermes — ``~/.hermes/state.db``, one SQLite database holding every session it
  has ever run, opened read-only. It is the odd one out even among these: there
  is no file per conversation, and Hermes titles its own, so nothing has to be
  scanned to build the list.

Listing is deliberately cheap: it reads only as far into a transcript as it
takes to find the first real user message, because the newest conversations
have to appear the moment the dialog opens. Reading a conversation back
(:func:`load_turns`) parses the whole file, and only happens for the one the
user actually chose.

Deliberately GUI-agnostic and free of any wx dependency, like
``markdown_rows``, so it can be unit-tested on its own (see
``tests/test_session_history.py``).

# ----- Hermes -----
#
# Hermes is the one backend that does not keep a file per conversation: every
# session it has ever run lives in one SQLite database. Two consequences shape
# the code below.
#
# First, the database is opened read-only and queried, rather than parsed. It
# is Hermes' own live store — the file a running Hermes is writing to — so this
# never opens it for writing and never runs anything that could block a writer.
#
# Second, ``path`` on a Hermes entry is that shared database, so the size guard
# in ``load_turns`` cannot apply to it: a busy Hermes' store passes tens of
# megabytes quickly (2 GB is ordinary on a machine that has run it for months),
# and applying a per-transcript limit to a shared store would silently hide
# every Hermes conversation. The equivalent protection here is a row limit on
