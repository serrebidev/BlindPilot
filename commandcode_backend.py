"""Command Code backend for BlindPilot.

Command Code (https://commandcode.ai) is a terminal coding agent installed
with ``npm install -g command-code``. Its package ships four bin names --
``cmd``, ``cmdc``, ``command-code`` and ``commandcode`` -- and this adapter
drives the ``command-code`` one on purpose: a Windows process that looks up
``cmd`` finds ``C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe`` first, which is the command
interpreter, not the agent.

It does not speak Claude Code's stream-json protocol. Its non-interactive
surface is its own: ``command-code -p --output-format json`` writes one event
object per line and a single final ``result`` line, and a conversation is
carried between runs with ``--resume <session id>`` (measured at 1.53.1, the
shapes this file reads). Discovery, authentication, the model catalog and the
stored session locations live here so ``agent_backends`` stays
provider-neutral; the turn itself is in ``commandcode_worker``.

CLI probes go through ``agent_backends._probe_backend`` and binary discovery
through ``agent_backends.find_backend_cli`` -- resolved at call time, not
imported into this module's namespace -- so the suite's "every backend"
tests, which patch those two in ``agent_backends``, fence this adapter off
from the machine it runs on exactly like the others.
