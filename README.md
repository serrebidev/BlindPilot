# BlindPilot

A screen-reader-first desktop front end for AI coding CLIs. It runs Claude Code, Codex, FreeBuff, opencode, Hermes, Muse Code, and Command Code in native wxPython windows, so NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver read controls instead of a terminal. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Linux is the least tested of the three.

Questions, bugs, and release news go to the [SerrebiProjects Telegram group](https://t.me/SerrebiProjects). Bug reports and feature requests also go in [Issues](https://github.com/serrebidev/BlindPilot/issues).

BlindPilot started as a fork of [Claude Code Reader](https://github.com/doubletaponair/claude-code-reader) by doubletaponair and keeps its accessibility design. See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## What it does

- Runs seven coding agents, picked per tab from Model, Backend. New tabs start on the backend of the tab you are in, and the choice is remembered. Once your tabs use more than one backend, each tab's name, its prompt, the announcement when you switch to it, and the pitch of its send sound all say which backend it sends to.
- Runs every backend in Bypass permissions mode by default, so a task does not stop to ask for approval. Change this under Model, Permission Mode.
- Splits every answer into rows you can arrow through, one per heading, paragraph, list item, quote, code block, thought, tool call, and tool result.
- Reads answers aloud as they stream, or stays silent until the whole answer is in.
- Speaks every step of a run, or only your message, the answer, and status changes. See Narration below.
- Reopens past conversations from any backend and continues them. Compacts a long one in place.
- Runs several sessions at once, one tab each, with its own folder, model, and permission mode.
- Answers the multiple-choice questions a backend stops to ask, in one dialog with radio buttons, checkboxes, and an Other box.
- Lets you steer a running task with a new message, or stop it and keep what it produced.
- Attaches files and pasted images.
- Searches responses and copies a code block, a response, or the whole conversation.
- Lists the models and effort levels the installed CLI reports.
- Plays optional sounds for sent, working, received, and failed.
- Installs, updates, adds to PATH, and signs in to any backend from a wizard.
- Has a Chat mode that talks to a provider API directly with no agent and no file access.
- Drives a Hermes on another computer over the network.
- Updates itself from GitHub Releases after checking the published SHA-256.
- Logs what it did, never what you or the model said.

## Install

Downloads are on the [Releases page](https://github.com/serrebidev/BlindPilot/releases). Version history is in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

Windows installer. Download `BlindPilot-Setup-x64.exe` and run it. It installs per user with no administrator prompt, adds a Start Menu entry, and closes a running copy before replacing it.

Windows portable. Download `BlindPilot-Windows-x64.zip`, extract it anywhere, run `BlindPilot.exe`.

macOS. Download `BlindPilot-macOS-arm64.zip` for Apple Silicon or `BlindPilot-macOS-x64.zip` for Intel. The builds are ad-hoc signed and not notarized, so the first launch may need approval in System Settings, Privacy & Security.

Linux. There is no packaged build. Run from source as described below.

Settings live in `%APPDATA%\BlindPilot\config.json` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/BlindPilot` on macOS, and `~/.config/blindpilot` on Linux. On macOS, settings from an older version are moved to the new folder once; nothing already there is overwritten. An existing Claude Code Reader configuration is imported once and never modified.

## Set up a backend

The first-run wizard and Model, Manage Backends find, install, update, and sign in to any of the seven backends. Claude Code, Hermes, and Muse Code use their own installers; on Windows, Muse Code is installed and run inside WSL. Codex, FreeBuff, opencode, and Command Code come from npm; BlindPilot installs Node.js LTS if npm is missing, installs the CLI into a per-user folder, adds it to PATH, and checks that it starts. No administrator rights are needed.

To do it by hand:

```powershell
# Claude Code
claude --version
claude auth login

# OpenAI Codex
npm install -g @openai/codex
codex login

# FreeBuff
npm install -g freebuff
freebuff login

# opencode
npm install -g opencode-ai
opencode providers login

# Command Code
npm install -g command-code
command-code login

# Muse Code, see https://developer.meta.com/ai/products/muse-code/
# On Windows, run these inside WSL.
curl -fsSL https://dev.meta.ai/install.sh | bash
muse login

# Hermes Agent, see https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs
hermes status     # shows the provider and model it will use
hermes model      # pick one, if none is set yet
```

Sign In in the wizard runs the backend's own login, reads the sign-in address from its output, speaks it, and opens your browser. Open Sign-in Page opens it again. If the provider hands back a code, BlindPilot asks for it and passes it to the CLI. Hermes is different. Its setup asks questions interactively, so Sign In opens a real terminal window for it. Answer the questions there, then choose Already Signed In.

opencode needs a provider connected to it. Use Model, Connect a Provider, or type `/connect`, or use the wizard. Pick a provider, then paste a key or sign in through the browser.

Type `/status` (or Model, Session Status) to hear the backend, model and effort, permission mode, folder, whether the next message continues this conversation, and which account the backend is signed in as.

## Menus

Every action is in the menu bar except three chords. Ctrl+L focuses the prompt, Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+9 jump to a tab, and Ctrl+Shift+M cycles permission modes.

File. New Session (Ctrl+T), Recent Conversations (Ctrl+Shift+H), Hermes Conversations (Ctrl+G, shown only when Hermes is the backend), Side Chat in This Folder, Next and Previous Session, Set Projects Folder, Create Desktop Shortcut, Close Session (Ctrl+W), Quit (Ctrl+Q).

Conversation. Stop Task (Ctrl+.), Attach Files (Ctrl+Shift+A), Slash Command (Ctrl+/), Compact Conversation (Ctrl+Shift+K), Start New Conversation (Ctrl+Shift+N), Find in Responses (Ctrl+F), Jump to Latest Response (Ctrl+R).

Model. Backend (one radio item per CLI), Model and Effort (Ctrl+Shift+E), Permission Mode (Default, Accept edits, Plan, Auto, Don't ask, Bypass permissions), Session Status, Backend Settings, Manage Backends, Connect a Provider.

Options. Show live activity in the list, Speak activity aloud, Include the backend's reasoning, Play sound cues, Narration (Follow everything, Keep up), Sounds (Message sent, Working, Answer received, Something went wrong), Responses as a read-only text field, Ask me questions a turn wrote into its answer, Silent until the response mode, Working sound (continuous, every few seconds, off), Working sound interval, Remote Hermes, Preferences (Ctrl+,). On macOS, Preferences is in the application menu on Cmd+, as in every Mac app.

Chat. Accounts, Conversation profiles, Refresh models, History view (List, Read-only text), Diagnostics. Enabled only when the Mode combo box is set to Chat.

Help. Check for Updates, Check for updates at startup, Open Log Folder, About BlindPilot.

Backend, Permission Mode, Narration, and Working sound are radio items, so a screen reader reports them as exclusive choices. Compact Conversation and Connect a Provider are greyed out for backends that have no equivalent.

### Narration

Follow everything, the default, speaks every tool call, result, and subagent line in order. Keep up speaks your message, the answer, and BlindPilot's own status lines, such as why a run is waiting or how it ended. The tool steps still appear in the list; they are not spoken. Use Keep up when a run fans out into many parallel steps and the speech queue falls behind. BlindPilot cannot shorten the screen reader's own queue, so this is the control it offers instead.

## Keyboard

- Ctrl+L focus the prompt. Ctrl+T open a session. Ctrl+W close it.
- Ctrl+Shift+H reopen a past conversation. Ctrl+G list Hermes conversations, including running ones.
- Ctrl+Shift+K compact this conversation. Ctrl+Shift+N start a fresh one.
- Ctrl+F search responses. Ctrl+R jump to the latest.
- Ctrl+Shift+E choose model and reasoning effort.
- Ctrl+/ slash commands. Ctrl+. stop the running task.
- Ctrl+Shift+A attach files. Ctrl+Shift+M cycle permission modes.
- Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab move between tabs, as do Ctrl+Shift+] and Ctrl+Shift+[. Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+9 jump to a tab. On macOS use Cmd+Shift+] and Cmd+Shift+[, because Cmd+Tab belongs to the system.
- Ctrl+Up (or Alt+Up) from the prompt enters the newest response. Shift+Tab also reaches the responses. Inside the responses, Down on the last row stays there; Tab returns to the prompt.
- Enter sends the prompt. Shift+Enter inserts a new line.

On macOS the Ctrl chords are Cmd. Two chords differ from what you might expect, so that macOS does not swallow them. Recent Conversations is Ctrl+Shift+H (Cmd+H is Hide), and Model and Effort is Ctrl+Shift+E (Cmd+M is Minimize).

## Backends

| Backend | How BlindPilot talks to it | Model and effort | Permission modes | Compaction | Asks questions |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | Streaming JSON CLI | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Codex | app-server protocol, one shared process | Yes, with reasoning effort | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| FreeBuff | Hidden pseudo-terminal | Model yes, effort no. GLM 5.3 Flash by default | Managed by FreeBuff | No | Yes |
| opencode | Its headless HTTP server, one shared process | Yes, with per-model reasoning variants | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Hermes | Gateway JSON-RPC over a local pipe or the network | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Muse Code | MSP JSON-RPC over the stdio of `muse serve`, inside WSL on Windows | Yes, with reasoning effort | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Command Code | Headless JSON CLI, one process per message | Yes, with reasoning effort | Yes | Yes | In writing only |

Every backend marked Yes in that column stops its turn and opens a question dialog through a question tool of its own. A model does not always use it: asked to interview you, or told to ask one question at a time, it will often write the question into its answer instead, and Command Code has its question tool withheld from headless runs altogether. A question written into an answer sends no event, so nothing used to announce it and no dialog opened - the turn simply ended, with no sign that anything was waiting on you. BlindPilot now reads the end of each answer, and a turn that ends by asking you something opens the same dialog, on every backend. What you type is sent as your next message. A turn that finished its work and signed off by offering the next step - "Want me to run the tests too?", "Anything else?" - is left to end quietly, because nothing is waiting on that answer and it is how most turns end; an offer that names a fork ("tabs or spaces?") is a decision, so it still asks. Turn the whole thing off under Options if you would rather a turn just end.

Claude Code and Codex are also told, in their own system instructions, to ask through their question tool rather than writing the question out. On Codex this is added to your own `developer_instructions` rather than replacing them.

FreeBuff has no JSON or headless API, so BlindPilot runs its terminal interface in a hidden pseudo-terminal and reads the answer off the screen a sentence at a time. Redraws and advertisements are filtered out. If you send a message before FreeBuff has finished starting, BlindPilot holds it and says so, then sends it when the session is live.

Codex runs as one app server shared by every tab. It starts with the first message, stays running between messages, and is closed after fifteen minutes with no turn. BlindPilot announces the close and the restart.

opencode runs as one server shared by every tab, on loopback, behind a password generated for the run. Past conversations are read from opencode's own database, read-only.

Hermes answers stream a sentence at a time. One connection is kept for the whole conversation. Hermes' reasoning channel carries a terminal spinner rather than reasoning, so that is filtered out.

A current Hermes keeps its blocking prompts on that same connection. A question, a dangerous-command approval and a password or secret request arrive as requests this window answers, which is the capability BlindPilot announces when it connects — a client that has not announced it is one the agent will not ask at all, and it waits out its full deadline instead. Reopening a conversation that is parked on a question hands that question back, so it is answered rather than left waiting. The few prompts with no window here to serve them — reading Hermes' in-app terminal or its browser preview, a password-manager entry — are declined rather than left unanswered, which is the same thing to the agent.

Muse Code is Meta's terminal coding agent. Its CLI ships for macOS and Linux, so on Windows BlindPilot reaches it inside WSL through the same bridge Hermes uses, translating the working directory on the way over. Turns run over Muse's own host protocol, MSP, with the answer streamed a fragment at a time and spoken in whole sentences. Tool approvals and the agent's own questions are put in front of you, and a past conversation reopens by its session id. When Meta refuses a request for want of Muse Spark access, BlindPilot says so instead of leaving the turn hanging.

Command Code runs one process per message. `-p` answers a single query and exits, so a running turn cannot be steered by the CLI itself and the next message resumes the conversation by the session id the CLI reports. BlindPilot supplies the missing pieces: a message sent while a turn is running is queued and goes out the moment that turn finishes, in order and with its attachments; Steer stops the running turn and resumes the conversation with your new instruction; Stop pauses the queue, and `/queue list`, `/queue clear` and `/queue resume` manage it. `/compact` summarizes the conversation into a new saved session and leaves the original in Recent Conversations. Its built-in commands cannot run headlessly — a slash string sent that way is treated as text — so the picker lists the ones BlindPilot provides equivalents for, explains the rest when typed, and never sends one to the model by accident. Mid-run questions are not offered.

### Hermes on another computer

With Options, Remote Hermes off, BlindPilot runs the Hermes installed here, including one installed in WSL.

For a Hermes on the same computer bound to localhost, a session token is enough:

```bash
HERMES_DASHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN=pick-a-long-random-string hermes serve --port 9119
```

For a Hermes reachable from other machines, Hermes requires a login before it will bind to a public address. Configure one on the machine running Hermes:

```bash
hermes config set dashboard.basic_auth.username your-name
# Hermes prints the hash to store; run this from its own installation:
python -c "from plugins.dashboard_auth.basic import hash_password; print(hash_password('your-password'))"
hermes config set dashboard.basic_auth.password_hash 'the-hash-it-printed'
hermes serve --port 9119 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then choose Username and password in Remote Hermes. Hermes issues a short-lived single-use ticket for each WebSocket connection; BlindPilot logs in and fetches one itself each time it connects. Test connection checks the address and credentials before anything is sent.

The two arrangements take different credentials, and Hermes does not say which one it is running:

- **A Hermes bound to a public address** (`--host 0.0.0.0`) requires a login and refuses a session token outright. Choose Username and password.
- **A Hermes bound to localhost**, reached through a tunnel or a reverse proxy, has no login to offer and refuses a ticket. Choose Session token. The token is the one `HERMES_DASHBOARD_SESSION_TOKEN` names, or the one Hermes prints for its own dashboard.

Behind a reverse proxy, Hermes must be told what address it answers to, or it refuses the request before it looks at any credential. Set `dashboard.public_url` to the address you connect to:

```bash
hermes config set dashboard.public_url https://hermes.example.com
```

BlindPilot reads the status Hermes refused with and says which of these it is, rather than reporting every refusal as a wrong key. It also says whether the refusal came from Hermes or from something answering in its place, because a proxy that refuses the connection writes its own page and names itself.

Behind a load balancer in front of more than one Hermes, the connection has to land on the same one that signed you in: a ticket is only known to the process that issued it. BlindPilot sends the session its login opened with the connection, which is what a load balancer with cookie affinity, and an authenticating proxy, both place it by.

`websocket-client` is only needed for the remote path. If it is missing, BlindPilot names it as an installable package and keeps running.

## Chat mode

Chat talks to a provider's API directly. No CLI, no agent, no file access.

Set the Mode combo box to Chat, add a provider and key under Chat, Accounts, then Chat, Refresh models and pick one. Supported providers are OpenRouter, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Z.AI, Moonshot AI, Kimi, DeepSeek, Command Code, OpenCode Go, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Keys go in the OS credential store.

Conversation profiles hold a system prompt, default account and model, temperature, token limit, and streaming preference. History view switches between a native list and a read-only edit field. Provider logs are under Chat, Diagnostics.

Every chat account takes attachments: images and PDFs go as the protocol's own content blocks, and any other file goes in as its text. OpenRouter accounts also get cache-aware regeneration, `:batch` model ids, OpenRouter's server-side tools (web search, web fetch, date and time, image generation, apply patch, shell, bash, fusion, advisor, subagent, tool search, model search), and thinking controls. Tools run on OpenRouter's servers, not your computer. Thinking effort sets how long a reasoning model thinks. Send the thinking back decides whether the thinking text is returned. Thinking arrives as its own History entry with a length line first. Read attached PDFs with converts a PDF to text for models that cannot read PDFs.

Chat data lives in `chat.sqlite3` beside the config. An existing AccessibleAI database is imported once and left unmodified.

## Logs

BlindPilot writes a rotating `blindpilot.log` and a `blindpilot-crash.log` for native crashes. Help, Open Log Folder opens the folder. It is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BlindPilot\Logs` on Windows, `~/Library/Logs/BlindPilot` on macOS, and `$XDG_STATE_HOME/blindpilot` on Linux. The log keeps at most four files of one megabyte.

The level is INFO. Set `BLINDPILOT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for a bug report. Prompts, answers, file contents, and credentials are never logged at any level. On Windows the crash log also records first-chance COM exceptions from screen-reader interop; those are noise, not crashes.

## Updates

Help, Check for Updates asks GitHub Releases for a newer version, downloads it, verifies the published SHA-256, and restarts into the installer. Check for updates at startup does the same quietly and only speaks when there is something new. Builds run from source open the release page instead.

## Run from source

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer. Releases are built with 3.12.
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. `python blind_pilot.py`

`blind_pilot.py` is the entry point; the code is in `blindpilot_app.py`.

## Build

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements-build.txt
python -m PyInstaller --noconfirm --clean BlindPilot.spec
```

`BlindPilot.spec` reads the version from `APP_VERSION` and carries the bundle identifier, minimum macOS version, and icon (`tools/make_icon.py` generates the icon files into `packaging/`). The one-directory layout is what lets the updater replace the app after it exits. The Windows installer is `installer/BlindPilot.iss`. Pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs the tests and the packaged startup checks, then publishes the Windows installer, the Windows zip, both macOS zips, and their SHA-256 files.

Before opening a pull request:

```powershell
python -m pytest -q -W error
python -m ruff check .
python -m ruff format --check .
python -m mypy
```

Pull requests are welcome.
