"""Keystone parser: turn an assistant Markdown response into navigable rows.

Each assistant turn arrives as Markdown text. We run it through
``markdown-it-py`` to get a token stream, then flatten that into an ordered
list of :class:`Row` objects — one header row per response, one prose row per
paragraph / heading / list / quote block, and one *code* row per fenced code
block.

Built for a screen-reader user, so prose is delivered as clean **plain text**:
emojis and decorative symbols are stripped, and Markdown syntax (``**bold**``,
``## headings``, ``` `code` ```, ``[link](url)``) is reduced to the words a
person actually wants to hear. Code rows keep pristine code so it can be copied
exactly.

This module is deliberately GUI-agnostic and has no wx dependency, so it can be
unit-tested in isolation (see ``tests/test_markdown_rows.py``).
